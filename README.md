First try at manipulating API data using vanilla JS

Went into project with goal of having pull random crime functionality where the page would display key points of a Baton Rouge crime as well as drop a pin on a google map with the location. The random crime Get worked but the pin drop needs some revisions.

Additionally I wanted to code to be able to pull a random crime by street name using the search input in the navbar. I had problems isolating the new text in the search bar using a keyup event listener. The actual street name needs to be pasted into the search bar in all caps instead of typed in for the code to pull it correctly. Additionally I had problems taking that new text and adding it to the api url. 

More thorough comments are located in my app.js file.
